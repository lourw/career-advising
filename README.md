## Applications 

Job searching for software roles often require these three components
1. resume + projects to get past initial screening stages
2. technical know-how to demonstrate your skills

### Resume Help <div id="resumes"/>
* ‚≠ê[Gayle McDowell's Resume](https://www.careercup.com/resume)
* [cscareers](https://www.cscareers.dev): join the resume-roast channel on the discord server

* üß† Tip: read through some resumes of developers before you start writing your own. Look for the following:
  * What tools and technologies are they using?
  * What projects are people working on?
  * How are they communicating their experience through the resume?
  
### Making Connections
**LinkedIn:** do not underestimate the power of LinkedIn when you are job searching. It can be a powerful tool if you know how to use it. Here are my tips on how to fully leverage LinkedIn
  * Use the `follow` feature. You can choose to `follow` other individuals on LinkedIn. This means their posts and content are more likely to pop onto your feed. Make sure you follow the recruiters and hiring managers of the companies you are interested in. This is a great way to stay up to date with application timelines and recruiting events
  * Networking. See someone interesting you want to chat with? You can send them a connection request or send them a message to coffee chat/ask for help. Sometimes networking this way may even end with referrals to positions that you're interested in 
  * Building relationships. One way to build connections with people is to engage with their content. If you see a post that is interesting, feel free to leave your own opinion. Authors do notice people who engage frequently with their content, which is another way for you to build your network.
  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you do make a LinkedIn profile, do not do the bare minimum! It should be completely filled out and up to date! 
  * Make sure you have filled in information about your experience, your 'about me' section, and also the various skills you have!
  * Do not mix work experience with extracurricular experience. Being the VP of a club does not mean you have executive experience and mixing your qualifications can be detrimental (you won't be taken as seriously)

### Supplementing your application <div id="projects"/>
Just a resume is not enough when you are starting out your job search. Make sure you have proof of any work or projects you've done! The following are some examples of supplementary activities/resources that could be useful

**Certifications**: Azure, AWS, Cloud certifications demonstrate knowledge of material
* [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/)
  * AZ900 - Azure Fundamentals (Basic)
  * AZ204 - Developer Associate (Intermediate)
* [AWS (Amazon Web Services)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/?trk=ps_a134p000006gXRtAAM&trkCampaign=GLBL-FY21-TrainCert-Certification_PaidSearch&sc_channel=PS&sc_campaign=FY21-TrainCert-Certification_PaidSearch&sc_publisher=Google&sc_category=Training%20and%20Certification&sc_country=CA&sc_geo=NAMER&sc_outcome=acq&sc_detail=aws%20certifications&sc_content=General_exact&sc_matchtype=e&sc_segment=465652894479&sc_medium=TC-P|PS-GO|Brand|Desktop|AW|Training%20and%20Certification|Certification|CA|EN|Text|xx|B2I&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!465652894479!e!!g!!aws%20certifications&ef_id=Cj0KCQiA5aWOBhDMARIsAIXLlkeXSaKVVEKV6n7MwPfARhP-Bk7GyGAQ5HoFbYeB85NjGRF5JJnZWoEaAo_jEALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!465652894479!e!!g!!aws%20certifications)
  * AWS Cloud Practitioner (Basic)
  * AWS Developer Associate (Intermediate)
  * AWS Solutions Architect (Intermediate)

**Personal Projects**: have a personal github account with repos of coding projects you've created

**Open Source Contributions**: be active in open source communities and see if there are ways you can contribute meaningful code to existing or new open source projects

**Hackathons**: great source to get hands on experience of new technologies and actually create something tangible. 
* ‚≠ê there is one hackathon out there each week, use [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/seasons/2022/events) to start looking for some

### Practicing your coding skills <div id="coding"/>
Use the following resources to aid you in passing technical interviews.  
‚ö†Ô∏è don't overthink the language you use. Use what you are most comfortable with (Java, C++, C#, Python, Javascript). I personally use Python because it's less verbose than Java or C++

üß† Tip: Doing these coding challenges is more than just memorizing the right answer, you should focus on also doing the following:
* learning about the patterns you see for when to apply certain algorithms or data structures
* after finishing a question, find ways to make it more efficient (less runtime or space complexity)
* be able to vocalize your thoughts. You don't want to be silent when doing this in front of an interviewer

Extra reads related to Leetcode:
* [Redditor's two cents to leetcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rp4bkw/how_to_leetcode_my_2_cents/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

[**Leetcode**](https://leetcode.com): most popular platform to test your skills and do algorithms/data structure questions

[**Hackerrank**](https://www.hackerrank.com): similar to Leetcode

[**CodeWars**](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard): similar to Leetcode, more gamified

[**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com): more oriented for machine learning and data science

[**Binary Search**](https://binarysearch.com/): similar questions to leetcode, but you can collaborate and compete with your friends

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Recommendation**: use this site here as a starting ground for different topics: [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/)

### Interview Activities <div id="interviews"/>
After the resume, you may encounter different candidate assessment methods. This is a non-exhaustive list of some of the different ways evaluations can be done. Expect 1-2 of them, but definitely not all when you are applying. Heavily dependent on the company you are applying to.

**Online Assessment**: Coding on a browser IDE. Often you are given 2-3 questions in a limited timeframe of 1.5-2 hours. Expect questions similar to leetcode
* Usually done unsupervised, but companies may be able to track your keystrokes and browser usage
* Companies: IBM, Amazon, Slack, DemonWare, Scotiabank Velocity

**Systems Design**: Given a prompt, walk through how you would go about designing a product/system
* "How would you go about designing an ecommerce platform?"

**Technical Question/Whiteboard**: In a call or room with an interviewer, explain how to go about solving a coding question (algorithms and data structures related)
* "Given a linked list of nodes, return a new linked list such that the nodes in the original are in reversed order"

**Technical Implementation**: Rather than solve an algorithm question, you may be expected to code out the implementation of a given prompt (making objects, classes, designing a small system)
* Companies: Stripe, Shopify

**Behavourial Questions**: Employers evaluate your responses to different scenarios or may ask you to reflect on your past experience. This is done for them to evaluate your fit into the company/team.
* "Tell me about a time you had to deal with a tight deadline and limited resources"

**Sample Project**: Given a prompt, create a small working prototype
* "Build a UI for a grocery store"
* "Construct an API for a movie catalogue"
* Companies: Shopify

**Personality Test/Worksplace Simulation**: Used to test for fit. Can be seemingly subjective at times. 
* RBC's mental aptitude game (45-min)
* Amazon's Workplace Simulation Activity + Personality Test (2-hours)

**Phone Interview**: Often just a phone call with a team manager or recruiter to evaluate on fit. Expect behavourials and potentially some technicals

**Conceptual Knowledge**: Dependent on the team and work you are applying for. You should have a good grasp of fundamental topics in your target domain.

### FAQ <div id="faq"/>

How many resumes do I need to send out before I get a job?
> No idea, but let's just say 50 every two weeks as a rough benchmark

Do I need cover letters?
> Depends. 
> For larger firms (Big N, SAP) where there are a high volume of applicants, cover letters probably won't get read  
> For smaller firms, make sure you tailor your cover letter to the job (generic cover letters actually reflect worse on you)

How important are referrals?
> Referrals can help boost your chances of making it past the resume stage of the application process. However, once you are in the interview stage of the process, it is all up to you to make sure you do coding practice and are prepared.

What kind of coding projects should I do?
> Depends. What are you interested in? You are not going to be able to code and finish a demo-able project unless you actually are interested in creating it.

There's a question about authorization and sponsorship (Canadian citizen applying for US jobs), what do I put?
> You are not authorized to work in the US (yet), so put NO for the authorization question. As a Canadian citizen, you need sponsorhip on a visa so you can put YES for the sponsorship question.
